# What is all this  *functional programming* about?

# It is about writing *composable programms*.

# It is might be accidently misused to exercise *intelectual violence*.

## The elephant in the room

- *Intellectual Violence* is a Project Managment *AntiPattern*.

- It occurs when *someone uses theory, technology or buzzword to intimidate
  others.*

- It leads to **defensive culture** and **breakdown of communication**

## Why do I talk about it?

- We are all knowledge industry professionals

- We are paid for what we know

- This means that we can feel we *should know* 

## Learning is emotionall

- Learning is not isollated from emotions

- Intellectual violence makes it harder to learn




## Back to the point

- I would like to talk about simple concepts: pure functions, function composition, currying,
  partial application.

- This simple concepts may take a lot time to learn and to understand right.

- I more or less understand them which may make me sound as an ass. Please tell me if you need more clarification.

# Composing programms
